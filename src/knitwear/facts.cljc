  "Per-jurisdiction knitted/crocheted apparel manufacturing compliance and
  labor-protection requirements.
  Every jurisdiction in this catalog is backed by an official spec-basis.
  NEVER invent requirements without an official citation.

  This is deliberately a starting catalog (honest coverage reporting) to
  prove the governor contract end-to-end, not a claim of global coverage.
  Adding a jurisdiction is additive: one map entry citing a real official
  source -- never fabricate a jurisdiction's requirements to make coverage
  look bigger.")
